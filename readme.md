Good new Hackers !
Our client demands an update for the artistify application.
The frontend will now be developed with ReactJs.
Some additional features may also be implemented.
- User favorites
- Search bar
- Comments

## PART I - The Backend

### The Repository

You'll find the base source code here : [base repo](https://github.com/Kostra0ne/artistify-react-1 "here")
Clone it and get ready for **ruuuumble** !!!!

Notice that the repo contains 2 main folders :
- client (the react application)
- server (the express application)

You will need 2 separate terminal windows to manage the 2 ends of the stack.

-----

### Preparing the backend

Do you **remember** express, mongo, dotenv, mongoose and friends ? <br>
Yes, No, Maybe ?<br>
**Don't worry** : it's time to refresh your memories :)

Start by checking the package.json to get an overview of the project.

---

#### Install dependencies: 

The usual shell process : 
once in the `/server` folder, run the following command to install required dependencies.

```bash=
npm install
```
---

#### The environment file: 

Create a `.env` file directly in `/server`, like so:

```env=
CLIENT_URL = http://localhost:3000
CLOUDINARY_NAME = your-name
CLOUDINARY_KEY = your-cloudinary-key
CLOUDINARY_SECRET = your-cloudinary-secret
MONGO_URI = mongodb://localhost/your-db-name
PORT = 5000
SECRET_SESSION = a-long-string-that-should-be-hard-to-crack
````

---

#### Seed the database

Some scripts in the package.json facilitate the seeding process.

```bash=
npm run seed:all
```

The one above will drop all existing collections and reseed with a fresh dataset.  
Don't forget to `ctrl + c` to kill the shell once the seeding is done !

A script is ready to seed each resource type individually !

```bash=
npm run seed:artist
npm run seed:album
npm run seed:style
npm run seed:label
```


You can reuse those tools as many times as needed during the workshop.

---

#### Make the server ready for incoming AJAX requests

Take a look to the package.json.
Notice any new library ? Yes : [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors "get cors on npm") was not there during module 2. This acronym stands for **C**ross **O**rigin **R**esource **S**haring. In a nutshell, it's meant to allow another domain name (here the client application), to communicate with the backend through AJAX requests.

The configuration of this middleware is pretty straight forward :

```js=
const corsOptions = {
  origin: [process.env.CLIENT_URL],
  credentials: true,
  optionsSuccessStatus: 200
};

app.use(cors(corsOptions));

```

---

#### Launch the backend

You should be ready to launch the server.

```bash=
npm run dev
```

Pay attention to the **backend** terminal to see if the app launched correctly.

---

### Express: Set the API routes

All the models files are already provided and required. üëç
All the routers files are already provided and required. üëç
You'll need to code the actual routes though. ü§ì
Today you'll only deal with READ and DELETE. üòÆ‚Äçüí®

#### The artists router

This file is located in `/server/routes/artists.js`.

| Route         | VERB | HTTP status          | Description                  |
| ------------- | ---- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| /artists       | GET  | 200 OR 500          | get all artists              |
| /artists/:id   | GET  | 200 OR 500          | get one artist by id         |
| /artists/:id   |DELETE| 200 OR 500          | delete one artist by id      |

**Should populate:** 
- style

---

#### The albums router

This file is located in `/server/routes/albums.js`.

| Route         | VERB | HTTP status         | Description                 |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| /albums       | GET  | 200 OR 500          | get all albums              |
| /albums/:id   | GET  | 200 OR 500          | get one album by id         |
| /albums/:id   |DELETE| 200 OR 500          | delete one album by id      |


**Should populate:** 
- artist
- artist.style
- label

---


#### The styles router

This file is located in `/server/routes/styles.js`.

| Route         | VERB | HTTP status         | Description                 |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| /styles       | GET  | 200 OR 500          | get all styles              |
| /styles/:id   | GET  | 200 OR 500          | get one style by id         |
| /styles/:id   |DELETE| 200 OR 500          | delete one style by id      |


---

#### The labels router

This file is located in `/server/routes/labels.js`.

| Route         | VERB | HTTP status         | Description                 |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| /labels       | GET  | 200 OR 500          | get all labels              |
| /labels/:id   | GET  | 200 OR 500          | get one label by id         |
| /labels/:id   |DELETE| 200 OR 500          | delete one label by id      |

### Postman: Test the routes

Postman is a really nice tool to **design, test and document REST APIs**. 

Create an artistify-react collection and implement the routes you created on the previous iteration, for the Albums and Artists collections.

**Hint:** Use the [course card](https://my.ironhack.com/lms/courses/course-v1:IRONHACK+WDFT+202109_PAR/modules/ironhack-course-chapter_4/units/005c089473bc4d2ca219b22b6d006d61 "postman course") for more infos.

## PART II - The Frontend

#### Install dependencies: 

The usual shell process : 
once in the `/client` folder, run the following command to install required dependencies.

```bash=
npm install
```


### Setting up the .env

Create a `.env` file directly in `/client`, like so:

```env=
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL = http://localhost:5000
```

Yes : react applications can also have environment variables !
Note that you **MUST** prefix **ALL** the keys with **REACT_APP_**{KEY}.

ex: `REACT_APP_MY_PAID_API_TOKEN = abcdefg1234`



---
### Lauch the client

```bash=
npm start
```

Pay attention to the **frontend** terminal to see if the app launched correctly.

Have a quick look to the available pages.


---

### Axios : the APIHandler

A tool is provided in `/client/api/handler.js` to make AJAX exchanges from client to server easier. The main idea is to avoid rewriting the axios instance's configuration multiple times. Be curious and check this file !

Here is an implementation example :

```javascript=
import APIHandler from "./api/APIHandler.js"

APIHandler.get("/albums")
.then({data} => console.log(data))
.catch(err => console.error(err));

```

---


### React + Axios: GET resources

Time to connect the dots. The front is ready to receive some datas from the backend

#### On the public artists page (http://localhost:3000/artists)

- Fetch all artists from the database.
- If the artists list is empty, display an info message in the list.
- Else, display a card for each artist.
- Provide a router <Link> to="/artists/artist.id" />,
- Leading to separate component ArtistDetails component.

#### On the public albums page (http://localhost:3000/albums)

- Fetch all albums from the database.
- If the albums list is empty, display an info message in the list.
- Else, display a card for each album.
- Provide a router <Link> to="albums/album.id" />,
- Leading to separate component AlbumDetails component.


**Note:** We will handle the <Like/> icon tomorrow.
**Hint:** Why don't you try CSS grid to organise the results display ?

### React + Axios: GET + DELETE resources

The dashboard is there to manage artists, albums, labels and styles.

- http://localhost:3000/admin/artists
- http://localhost:3000/admin/albums
- http://localhost:3000/admin/labels
- http://localhost:3000/admin/styles

Your task here is to :
- Fetch and display resources from the backend.
- Plug the delete buttons to a handler, removing the desired resource in the backend.

Here is an overview of the desired results :
